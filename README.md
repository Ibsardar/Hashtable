# Hashtable

A hashtable object which takes an input file (of words) and stores all the content into a hashtable using a collision resolution of seperate chaining. Takes advantage of ASCII definitions and the nature of an alphabetical-only input by bypassing unnecessarily, complex hash functions; this causes implementations to become easier. However, security risks are more imminent using this approach.
