Figured it out:

1) You have to make a makefile; I use PuTTY to accomplish this for example.

2) Since we want the makefile to be "extension-less", producing the makefile in Unix is ideal.

3) here's how you would write it in this case (in PuTTY, using vi editor) :

    vi makefile [PRESS ENTER]

    
    HT: hashTable.o linkedList.o main.o
              g++ hashTable.o linkedList.o main.o -o HT
    hashTable.o: hashTable.cpp hashTable.h linkedList.h
              g++ -c hashTable.cpp
    linkedList.o: linkedList.cpp linkedList.h
              g++ -c linkedList.cpp
    main.o: main.cpp hashTable.h linkedList.h
              g++ -c main.cpp
    clean:
              rm -f *.o


The basic setup here is:

    Label: all object files seperated with a space
           g++ all object files seperated with a space -o Label
    objectFile.o: objectFile.cpp  dependencies.h ...etc.
           g++ -c objectFile.cpp
    .      
    .      
    .      
    etc........................
    clean:
           rm -f *.o


#--EDIT--

If you don't want to make a makefile, you can defenitely just type in PuTTY the following: 

> g++ -o HT hashtable.cpp linkedList.cpp main.cpp

However, you will have to type this every time you alter your code as opposed to the makefile.
